  abstract = {This work studies the security of ten popular package managers. These package managers
  use different security mechanisms that provide varying levels of usability and resilience
  to attack. We find that, despite their existing security mechanisms, all of these
  package managers have vulnerabilities that can be exploited by a man-in-the-middle
  or a malicious mirror. While all current package managers suffer from vulnerabilities,
  their security is also positively or negatively impacted by the distribution's security
  practices. Weaknesses in package managers are more easily exploited when distributions
  use third-party mirrors as official mirrors. We were successful in using false credentials
  to obtain an official mirror on all five of the distributions we attempted. We also
  found that some security mechanisms that control where a client obtains metadata and
  packages from may actually decrease security. We analyze current package managers
  to show that by exploiting vulnerabilities, an attacker with a mirror can compromise
  or crash hundreds to thousands of clients weekly. The problems we disclose are now
  being corrected by many different package manager maintainers.},
